# CSpell Dictionaries

These `.txt` files contain various dictionaries of custom words that should be accepted by the spelling checker.

Two dictionaries are provided by default:

1. `ops.txt` contains words from the template controls and operations of the project
2. `project.txt` contains words that should be accepted from the project

Additional dictionaries can be added as-needed (e.g., for translations, etc).
