# This automatically pulls the first line after the double-hash (`##`) comment for each target to print as the help. New
# targets usage instructions are auto-generated, so long as the comment formatting remains correct. Targets must use the
# following comment pattern for this to function correctly:

# ```make

# # This comment and all following comments won't appear.
# #
# target:

#
# Private targets should start with an underscore (`_`) to prevent having their information listed here. Targets
# intended for a special purpose should start with a period (`.`) and also won't appear here.
