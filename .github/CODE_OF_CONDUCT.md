## Community pledge

A positive and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality, or level of
experience, is a key dedication for the project's Owners and Maintainers, known colloquially as the _Community Leaders_,
to provide. The Community Leaders won't tolerate the harassment of any person, regardless of how they interact with the
project and the community, nor do the Community Leaders tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to another
person feeling unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their physical or emotional well-being. All communication should be
appropriate for a professional audience, including people of many different backgrounds.

This project's Community Leaders value diverse opinions, but they value respectful behavior more.

## Community standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for this community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what's best, not just for one's priorities, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Be kind to others. Don't insult or put down other community members. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and
sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes aren't appropriate at any time, on any forum.

Each individual is entirely responsible for their own actions.

### Peaceful resolution

The Community Leaders for this project don't believe that all conflict is necessarily bad. Healthy debate and
disagreement often yields positive result. It's never okay to be disrespectful, however.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, the Community Leaders encourage you to address the behavior directly with
those involved. This often provides a quick and easy resolution, and this gives the parties more control over the
outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or
harassing, report it. An environment where participants feel welcome and safe is the dedication the Community Leaders
commit to with this policy.

## Community Leader responsibilities

The clarification of standards of acceptable behavior is the responsibility of the Community Leaders, and they're
expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community Leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
Issues, Discussions, Pull Requests and other contributions that aren't aligned to this Code of Conduct, and they're
responsible for communicating the rationale of such moderation decisions, when appropriate.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the
project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline
event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by Project Maintainers.

---

## Enforcement

Contact the Community Leaders at any time to report instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior.
All complaints result in a review, investigation, and response appropriate and necessary to the circumstances. Community
Leaders always maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of any incident. On occasion, Community Leaders may
post details of specific enforcement policies separately.

Project Maintainers who don't follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent
repercussions as determined by other members of the Community Leadership.

### Reporting an incident

If you experience harassment, notice that someone else is experiencing harassment, or have any other concerns, please
contact the Project Owner directly [by email][email].

Community Leaders investigate each and every report, but you may not receive a response. The use of discretion in
determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents ranges from not taking action to permanent expulsion from
the project and project-sponsored spaces.

Community Leaders shall notify the accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before they take
any action. The identity of the reporter is always omitted from the details of any report supplied to accused parties.
It's possible for the Community Leaders to take action without notice in potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing
harassment or threats to anyone's safety.

### Enforcement guidelines

Community Leaders shall follow this Code of Conduct in determining the consequences for any action they deem in
violation of this Code of Conduct. The Project Owner has full and final discretion over the appropriate action and any
appeals regarding the administration of these guidelines, including any deviations.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

#### 1. Correction for minor infractions

##### Community impact

Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

##### Consequence

A private, written warning from Community Leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an
explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. Community Leaders may require a personal or public apology.

#### 2. Warning for repeat or moderate infractions

##### Community impact

A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

##### Consequence

A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited
interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding
interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a
temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary ban for sustained or serious infractions

##### Community impact

A serious violation of community standards, including sustained, inappropriate behavior.

##### Consequence

A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
Immediate placement of a prohibition on parties to the ban from interacting with any people involved during the ban
period, including Community Leaders enforcing the Code of Conduct, in public or private forms, using direct or indirect
methods of contact, whether solicited or unsolicited, is the primary method of discipline for such behavior.

Violation of any of these terms universally results in the enforcement of a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent ban for sustained or severe infractions

##### Community impact

Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of
an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

##### Consequence

A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
