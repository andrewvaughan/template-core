## Community Pledge

This project and its Owners and Maintainers (hereinafter, the Community Leaders) are dedicated to providing a positive
and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality, or level of experience.
We do not tolerate harassment of any person, regardless of how they interact with the project and the community, nor do
we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to another person being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened
for their physical or emotional well-being. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience,
including people of many different backgrounds.

We value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more.

## Community Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other community members. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment
and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at any time, on any forum.

Each individual is entirely responsible for their own actions.

### Peaceful Resolution

We do not believe that all conflict is necessarily bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yields positive result.
It is never okay to be disrespectful, however.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved.
Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If
you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are
dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

## Community Leader Responsibilities

Community Leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for
moderation decisions, when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the
project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline
event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at
any time. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter
of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent
repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

### Reporting an Incident

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the
project owner directly [by email][email].

Every report will be investigated, but you may not receive a response. We will use our discretion in determining when
and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from the
project and project-sponsored spaces.

We will notify the accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The
identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful
situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without notice.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow this Code of Conduct in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation
of this Code of Conduct. The project Owner has full and final discretion over the appropriate action and any appeals for
these application of these guidelines, including any deviations:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the
community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation
and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including
unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding
interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a
temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained, inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified
period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those
enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate
behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Conclusion

We hope you will join us in developing our community as a part of this project. With respect and empathy in mind, we can
ensure that others will follow.
