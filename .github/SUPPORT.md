## Tips for Getting the Fastest Support

If you are looking to get support for this project, we aim to help. One of the best ways to ensure you receive the
fastest resolution is to exhaust as many resources as you have available prior to asking for community assistance. Some
recommendations we have to start include:

1. Perform a [Rubber Duck Debugging][rubber-duck] exercise
2. Rephrase your question after reading about the [X-Y Problem][xy]
3. Search for other issues in the project that might help you get context more quickly
4. Gather as much data as you can - screenshots, error message, verbose logs - and include them up front

The more effort you put into preparing your question, the more likely a community member will engage and be able to
answer the question quickly, letting you get back to doing what actually matters.
