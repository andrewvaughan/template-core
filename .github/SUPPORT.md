## Tips for getting the fastest support

If you are looking to get support for this project, as an open source project, the community is the primary source for
that. One of the best ways to ensure you receive the fastest resolution is to exhaust as many resources as you have
available prior to asking for community assistance. Some recommendations to start include:

1. Perform a [Rubber Duck Debugging][rubber-duck] exercise
2. Rephrase your question after reading about the [X-Y Problem][xy]
3. [Search for other Issues][gh-issues] in the project that might help you get context more quickly
4. Gather as much data as you can - screenshots, error message, verbose logs - and include them up front

The more effort you put into preparing your question, the more likely a community member engages and answers your
question quickly, letting you get back to doing what's important to you.
