# Linters that support fixing in-place do so within the commit.
#
# When applying basic fixes, this doesn't create another Pull Request or commit - MegaLinter fixes small changes
# in-place during testing. Modify this in the `.github/workflows/.mega-linter.yml` configuration, if needed.

  # Lychee is _extremely_ slow right now, and Markdown link checking occurs with other linters. Consider the usefulness
  # of dead hyper link checking in code comments before re-enabling.

##
# MegaLinter doesn't lint code by default, rather limiting linting to `.md` and `.rst` files. These configurations add
# certain file extensions, some of which are natively supported, and others have their mapping in the `vale.ini` file.
#
# > Note, YAML is explicitly not supported as many project benefit from having in-editor prose linting of content
# > blocks, and this capability would disappear if comments were solely linted. As such, a compromise solution is to not
# > lint YAML during integration, but enable visualization and management of possible errors in the editor.
#
# > Note, JSON is explicitly not supported as there seems to be a problem parsing text in arrays. Since comments aren't
# > supported in JSON, generally, this adds minor risk.
