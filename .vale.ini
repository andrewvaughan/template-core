# Vale prose linter.
#
# Vale is a command-line and open source linting tool that allows developers to define and apply custom rules for
# documentation/editorial style guides. Incorporating Vale in documentation helps to detect errors and provides error-
# fixing suggestions.
#
# MegaLinter manages all execution of this linter.

# Two vocab sets exist for ops and the project.
#
# This isn't used for spellcheck, as CSpell manages that. Instead, this informs Vale what words to treat as proper nouns
# and various formatting standards.

# These Vocab configurations are available in the `.config/linters/vale/styles/Vocab` folder.

# Inline ignores.
#
# Vale ignores the following in-line scenarios:
#
#   1. Inline `code examples`
#   2. Comment markers starting with `@`
#
# TODO Additionally, this configuration ignores all URLs due to a problem with Vale being able to decipher URLs in code
# blocks. This is an interim fix.
