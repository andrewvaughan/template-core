/**
 * VSCode extension recommendations
 *
 * This configuration helps new developers get up and running as quickly as possible to dive right into coding. It,
 * along with the associated `settings.json` file parallel, configure enough of a Microsoft VSCode workspace to provide
 * testing, linting, and code policy enforcement and avoid surprises during integration.
 *
 * By no means must you install or configure these extensions as-presented, but the CI/CD integration pipeline enforces
 * the policies they represent at time of integration, regardless of whether they're in use or not. Please feel free to
 * override or modify your user or local workspace settings, as works best for you, but don't commit your changes to the
 * Repository. Project Maintainers reject any commits that include changes to these files.
