## Installation

<!-- TEMPLATE TODO -->

_Add a brief introduction as to how users, not developers, perform a normal installation of the project._

### Dependencies

<!-- TEMPLATE TODO -->

_Add detail in this section regarding any dependencies or installation requirements that users, not developers, need
before installing and using the tool. This **must** focus on **using** the tool, not developing it. Delete this section
if there are no production dependencies required for the project._

### Quick start

<!-- TEMPLATE TODO -->

_Add a brief set of instructions on how to get quickly up and running for the most-common use cases. Delete this section
if a quick-start concept doesn't apply._

### Manual installation

<!-- TEMPLATE TODO -->

_If manual installation steps differ from the quick-start in the preceding section, add more verbose instructions here.
Otherwise, delete this section._

---

## Usage

<!-- TEMPLATE TODO -->

_Provide detailed instructions on how to use this project, if applicable. Otherwise, delete this section._

### Configuration

<!-- TEMPLATE TODO -->

_If the project has configuration capabilities, provide them here in full detail. Otherwise, delete this section._

---

### Developer installation

<!-- TEMPLATE TODO -->

_Add details for developers on how to setup their environment, including installing additional, developer dependencies,
for individuals wishing to contribute to the project._

#### Developer dependencies

<!-- TEMPLATE TODO -->

_Add or modify this section to describe the dependencies used in development._

This project aims to be as agnostic as possible across all development environments. As such, development dependencies
are purposely limited to a few critical elements:

| Dependency             | Purpose                                                                    |
|:-----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [act][inst-act]        | Allows for running the project's GitHub [actions][actions] locally         |
| [Docker][inst-docker]  | Virtualization platform used for testing, running, and building code       |
| [GNU Make][inst-make]  | Primary tool for executing test, build, clean, and other commands          |
| [Node.js][inst-nodejs] | Used to download certain command-line packages for `npx`                   |
| [npx][inst-npx]        | Node.js package execution helper to run certain non-containerized commands |

### Testing

An important part of the project's [Software Development Lifecycle][sdlc] is continuous testing. The configuration of
the project aims to make this as low effort as possible. Ensure that you have the
[developer dependencies](#developer-dependencies) installed and run the following command:

```bash
make test
```

This runs a full test suite. The project provides a number of utility functions to make your life easier during
development. You can find the full list by running:

```bash
make help
```
